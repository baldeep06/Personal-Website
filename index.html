            <p>
              I think I might've mentioned it already, I'm a student. I have to study. A lot. Makes sense given that I'm
              in The University of Waterloo's elusive "Math" Faculty. And sometimes it can be hard. Really hard. But the
              satisfaction from finishing that assignment or handing in that exam, it makes it all worth it.

            <h3>This team is ruining my life!</h3>
            <p>
              Thanks Steve Dangle, couldn't have said it any better myself. If you have't already caught on, I'm a
              Toronto Maple Leafs fan. Have been ever since....well ever since I can remember. I ask myself everyday,
              "why did you pick this horrible team?" I could't give you an answer for the life of me. It's been what, 7
              years in the Matthews era and only one playoff series win? I don't think I'll live to see a Leafs cup win.
              It's already been 57 years, anyways.

            <h3>The train</h3>
            <p>
              The train. Who doesn't love trains? Politicians don't, apparantly. Ever since I was a child, the nearby
              railroad tracks have always fascinated me. You're telling me thousands of tons of machinery is just
              whirring down a pair of two steel rods? How cool is that? And the best feeling in the world is when you're
              on one of these mighty beasts, whirring past traffic. As of late, I've had to make nearly commutes from my
              University to my home, which has required me to board a cramped bus. When a train, going the same route
              exists. Why, you might ask? Well, it's because seemingly everyone in this country doesn't care if our
              trains run at all. I'm getting a bit too animated now. Point is, I like trains.

              Imagine taking a database of stocks and making the safest possible portfolio with it. Now imagine doing the same thing, but risky instead. You would generate a portfolio that would likely be the most exciting portfolio known to humankind, but perhaps the most terrifying. The Financial Robo-Advisor is the mastermind behind this crazy portfolio.

              This website may seem nothing out of the ordinary, but fear not, it has a lot more to it. And by a lot more, all I mean is that the website talks about me! And I consider myself perhaps slightly less than ordinary. This website skillfully uses HTML, CSS and Javasript, and the best part about it is that it will constantly be improving, just like me!
